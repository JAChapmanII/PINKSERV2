pbrane is an IRC bot.

pbrane has what people might consider NIH syndrome, however it is meant as an
excercize in play and learning.


Building:
	This is a huge mess right now. I would not attempt it unless you're
	familiar enough with both c++ and the project itself to figure it out on
	your own. You're always free to hit me up if it's taking me too long to
	update these instructions though.

	First of all, you may wish to change some constants in src/config.cpp .
	This will eventually move to a simple config file that doesn't require
	recompilation to see changes.

	Then run:
		make

	Or:
		tup

Running:
	This can be as simple as (but probably isn't):
		./bin/pbrane

	More likely you may wish to try:
		./bin/rpbrane.sh

	Or try:
		./bin/rpscript.sh <pscript name> # such as sl
	you can get a list of pscripts by looking in pscript/

	Initially pbrane starts out as a blank slate. For common useful bits,
	pipe the newbot file to her:
		cat ./newbot.pbrane | ./bin/rpbrane.sh


	You may want to investigate the jitro project if you wish to get pbrane
	connected to a real IRC network.
