pbrane is an IRC bot.

pbrane has what people might consider NIH syndrome, however it is meant as an
excercize in play and learning.


Building:
	First of all, you may wish to change some constants in src/config.cpp .
	This will eventually move to a simple config file that doesn't require
	recompilation to see changes.

	Then run:
		make

	Or:
		tup

Running:
	This can be as simple as (but probably isn't):
		./bin/pbrane

	More likely you may wish to try:
		./bin/rpbrane.sh

	Or try:
		./bin/rpscript.sh <pscript name> # such as sl
	you can get a list of pscripts by looking in pscript/

	Initially pbrane starts out as a blank slate. For common useful bits,
	pipe the newbot file to her:
		cat ./newbot.pbrane | ./bin/rpbrane.sh


	You may want to investigate the jitro project if you wish to get pbrane
	connected to a real IRC network.
