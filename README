pbrane is a simple IRC bot written in C++.

Building:
	First of all, you may wish to change some constants in the source itself.
	At some point I need to move this into a config as jbotc does it.

	Then run:
		make

Running:
	This can be as simple as
		./pbrane

	This works much the same way as jbotc. See its README for more information
	and to see how to get pbrane connected to an IRC channel.
