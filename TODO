boost:
	report the bug with boost regex and
		!push/annoying/^((.)(.)((?1)|)).*?$/\U\2\L\3\4

TODO:
	why is there a modules and a requests section? They're very blurred.

pbrane
	include the topic in lastLog
	rate limit
	handle ACTIONs better

General
	non-hard coded configuration
	dynamic nick changing

Modules
	!s: accept quoted arguments, have mechanism for going back further than
		last match
	Add GABEN mode
	say goodnight to people
	say hello to people
	Have PredefinedRegexFunction match the replacement regex too
	fix .* matching twice while .+ works properly
	play wit PkgnBotX
	prevent bot fights better
	!botsnack
	bonzairob: add !teatime

Requests:
	Cacapulse: !gaga
	randomly yell <USERNAME> IS A SPY after <user> posts (5% chance)
	ZeldaFan: insult people on leaving channel
	____________jext: need a delete function
	Solshine: command 'recharge' time to prevent command spam automatically
	jac: when ^ is implemented, stroke Solshine's ego


Allow function to specify whether we should direct it at a person, instead of
doing line.nick + ": " manually. This also fixes the private message thing.


overhaul help system, it sucks
m_write not really needed right?
!help -> ?
expose config variables as !set-etc'able things





markov probability
