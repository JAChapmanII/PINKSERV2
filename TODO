boost:
	report the bug with boost regex and
		!push/annoying/^((.)(.)((?1)|)).*?$/\U\2\L\3\4

TODO:
	why is there a modules and a requests section? They're very blurred.

Connection manager
	get it to at least running a binary
	connecting to multiple channels
	connecting to multiple networks
	handle more of the IRC protocol (more errors, identifying, etc)

pbrane
	include the topic in lastLog
	rate limit
	handle ACTIONs better

General
	non-hard coded configuration
	dynamic nick changing

Modules
	!s: accept quoted arguments, have mechanism for going back further than
		last match
	Add russion roulette
	Add tell function
	Add GABEN mode
	say goodnight to people
	say hello to people
	Have PredefinedRegexFunction match the replacement regex too
	fix .* matching twice while .+ works properly
	play wit PkgnBotX
	prevent bot fights better
	allow "articifial" flag to work on own output
	!botsnack
	bonzairob: add !teatime
	!ignore: actually save these

Requests:
	Cacapulse: !gaga
	randomly yell <USERNAME> IS A SPY after <user> posts (5% chance)
	ZeldaFan: insult people on leaving channel
	Golurk: AnNoYiNgIfIeR
	____________jext: need a delete function
	Solshine: command 'recharge' time to prevent command spam automatically
	jac: when ^ is implemented, stroke Solshine's ego


Allow function to specify whether we should direct it at a person, instead of
doing line.nick + ": " manually. This also fixes the private message thing.
