Modules should be defined in the modules/ directory.

To get your modules detected and integrated at compile time, you must add
special comments denoting how to load/unload the module and what functions
belong to it.

All modules should have a #m line. The general format is:
	// #m: module name: description: name of load function: name of save function

If there is nothing to do on load/save, you can put "none" there.


For any functions you want accesible from the running pbrane environment, you
should have a #f line. The format of these lines is:
	// #f: function name: description (used as help message)

If the pbrane function name should be different from the C++-source function
name, you can put the following in the function name field:
	c++_name = pbrane_name
