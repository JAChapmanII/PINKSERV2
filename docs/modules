Modules should be defined in the modules/ directory.

To get your modules detected and integrated at compile time, you must add
special comments denoting how to load/unload the module and what functions
belong to it.

If your module has data that must be loaded at startup or saved at shutdown,
make sure you have a #m line. The general format is:
	// #m: module name: name of load function: name of save function: description

For any functions you want accesible from the running pbrane environment, you
should have a #f line. The format of these lines is:
	// #f: function name: description (used as help message)
